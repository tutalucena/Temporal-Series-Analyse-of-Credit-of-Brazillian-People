Mental health is a matter of concern, with technological advances and the greater dependence of human beings on the digital environment, it is 
increasingly necessary to include and monitor how the mental health of those involved in this environment is doing. In 2020, a world population 
was impacted by COVID-19 which has overwhelmingly changed the way we interact interpersonally. The Home Office work environment increased on scales

home, and personal life was temporarily confiscated.
